Description
The maxSubArray function implements an efficient algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional vector of integers. This problem is commonly known as the "Maximum Subarray Problem," and it can be solved using Kadane's Algorithm with a time complexity of O(n).
